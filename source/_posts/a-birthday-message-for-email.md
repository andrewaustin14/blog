title: A birthday message for email

Email turned 44 years old last month. That's right, the first email was sent in 1971. And 22 years after it launched to the mainstream public, email is kicking goals as the most popular form of communication between customers and businesses.

So email has to be doing something right, right? Because despite all its younger competitors&mdash;the 20 year old search engines and the barely adolescent social media platforms&mdash;email is leading the way. And in the customer experience space, the unassuming veteran of digital communications is still capturing attention as the feedback platform of first choice.

What about the data? Microsoft recently released its 2015 report into multichannel customer service in the United Kingdom. You can check out the full report [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics/multichannel-customer-service). Let's agree that this study is broadly representative of customer engagement in a robust modern economy with a vibrant consumer sector - i.e. Britain has some lessons for the rest of us.

For those of you who aren't consumer experience geeks like us, here are the basics.

82% of customers regularly use email to engage a brand. This compares to 72% who jump on the telephone, 58% on live chat, 46% on Google or other search engine, 18% on social media and 14% who use online forums.

When it comes to first preference, the contrast is even starker. 96% of customers would prefer to use email, telephone or live chat, with a nearly even split between all three. And although an approximate [81% of small and medium businesses use social media](http://mashable.com/2014/02/13/linkedin-social-media-study/#kXvLyPP37sq3) as marketing strategy, only a mere 2% of customers favour social media as the best way to engage a brand. Stacked up against the plethora of social media and messaging platforms out there, why does email stand out?

A few thoughts. First, email promises direct contact with the decision maker, or at the minimum, a **real person**. This is critical, and it helps to explain why the telephone and live chat are so popular too. The idea of connecting with a real human being who, for a moment of their day is listening to just you, is an incredibly powerful motivator. This is especially valuable when you are upset, frustrated or thrilled by an experience - all common emotions at play when customers are motivated enough by a brand experience to provide feedback.

Two, **email is a reliable, consistent and universal interface**. Email is predictable. And that's what customers want. Given the little time that customers are prepared to engage with a business to provide feedback, the offering of multiple social media platforms and bespoke business apps just don't cut it. Keeping in mind that effort is still the biggest disincentive to customer feedback, email is just easy. Every business has an email address, it's accessible through the same inbox every time and there is a nearly 100% chance that your message will get in front of the person you intend. Ubiquitousness is not a guarantee of great customer service but it is a good start.

And finally three, **email balances formality and ease just nicely**. In the same way that writing a letter offers the innate satisfaction of having told your story on paper, email echoes this. It guarantees a certain level of respect between writer and reader in a way that a tweet or a comment box blurb often can't. In the age of information overshare, the privacy of email also gives our stories just that little bit more credibility than posting our rants online. 

With 75% of customers starting their engagement with a business on their computer and 25% on a mobile, email is the first choice for brand engagement. That is, until we see something else come into the marketplace that can compete for customer attention in the same ubiquitous way that email does (watch this space!).
 
So email may not be the only answer for long, but for now it has some key takeaways for any business that cares about its customers.
 
Happy birthday email.

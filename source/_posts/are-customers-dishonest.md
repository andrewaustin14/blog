title: Are Customers Dishonest?

Just in case you’re not following the news, Amazon recently filed a claim in Seattle, [suing 1,114 people](http://news.sky.com/story/1571496/amazon-sues-1114-fake-reviewers-for-hire) for allegedly posting fake reviews on its website.

According to Amazon, the defendants were gaming the system by offering to provide reviews for money through the popular 'micro-services' broker Fiverr.com. Reviewers promised to write positive reviews of products, which affected the integrity of the Amazon customer review system and according to Amazon, had caused 'an unhealthy ecosystem to develop to supply reviews in exchange for payment'.

This was systematic cheating with a clear motivation – payment for a service. But it begs the question: how many customers are regularly dishonest in their business transactions?  Now we're not talking about theft or stealing or daylight robbery – naturally, a small proportion of the community are that way inclined. We are talking about the white lies, the small acts of deceit that over time cost businesses real money. Think of returning a product under a false pretext; or attempting to claim a store-offered incentive without purchasing the required item; or making a false complaint about a meal to claim a discount next time. Or the big one: posting an exaggeratedly nasty review online simply to punish a business or force a refund.

Statistics say that 1-4% of customers will systematically try to cheat. But since the arrival of online review platforms, the line between cheating and expressing your strong dissatisfaction online has blurred. So this statistic may be higher if we include the vocal minority who intentionally manipulate businesses through posting extremely bad reviews. Or those who are paid to post fake reviews. Yelp, for example, estimates that 16% of restaurant reviews are fraudulent.

For Amazon, suing 1,114 people was a strategic move to protect their credibility. For most other businesses, the problem is preventing actual losses while managing image. How do you avoid blaming an honest customer? How do you treat a dishonest customer without descending into an embarrassing argument in person or online? And how does this all look to honest customers watching on?

This is a big topic but here are three ideas for businesses to start with:

1. **Strategically manage the incentives to cheat**. Like anyone, customers are economic actors who respond to incentives and disincentives. If it's easier and more profitable to do they right thing, they probably will. So make it easy for your good customers to provide feedback, return products and resolve complaints. This will make it harder for your dishonest customers to have an impact. And, it will be good for your bottom line.

2. **Take it offline** (not literally). If somebody has a genuine complaint, they won’t mind making the conversation private - whether in person, by email or other channels. Provided you are willing to consider their issue and give it the attention they think it deserves, most customers are willing to forgive transgressions if they feel cared about. Nobody benefits from public confrontations and online rants. Absolutely nobody.

3. **Be the higher person**. Like with any customer who engages with your business, responding to a dishonest customer is an opportunity to build your brand. Treat a dishonest customer so well that everyone watching on cannot help but be impressed by your superior customer service - and you will win the loyalty of many more good customers. You may even convert the bad one.

title: The Problem
date: October 6 2015

Let's face it – consumers are presented with constant opportunities to provide feedback. This is not a new challenge and the marketplace is saturated with options, both digital and old–school. Businesses and other organisations supplement feedback forms, surveys and focus groups with social media monitoring, website usability testing, community review boards, individually tailored mobile application and web–based market research platforms. To name a few in the digital domain – Yelp, TripAdvisor, Zomato, SurveyMonkey, UserVoice, Feedbackify, Kampyle, OpinionLab, IdeaScale, Yomstar, Satmetrix. The list goes on...

So why Critik? Do customers need another option to get their voices out there to the people that really want to know? We as customers are constantly bombarded with opportunities to tell businesses what we think. Survey forms abound and nearly every online booking, be it for flights, hotels or dinner out, involves some a request to contribute feedback. Despite the most plentiful existence of feedback tools ever, consistent customer engagement is still low.  No tool out there comprehensively alleviates the barriers that prevent an average 75% percent of consumers from providing feedback.  Statistics suggest that survey response is often as little as two percent. Even the current market leader in online surveys claims that a highly successful response rate is in the realm of 20–30%.

So that's the first problem, getting customers to speak up. This is about both quantity (regular consistent engagement) and quality (a healthy ratio of insightful feedback to general rants!). And for us at Critik, we see this as simply a question of customer motivation; how do we unlock what the customer already wants to say?

Seven simple but significant barriers stop consumers speaking up:

1. **The Effort Factor**: Customers want to provide feedback but ultimately cannot be bothered. Good intentions fail because it all just feels a bit exhausting.
2. **The Lack of Access Factor**: Customers are dissuaded by a lack of easily apparent ways to provide feedback.  Conversely, they feel they have no guarantee it will be passed to the intended recipient.
3. **The Embarrassment Factor**: Customers do not want to complain because of potential embarrassment to themselves or others.
4. **The Defeatist Factor**: Customers believe that their feedback is unlikely to lead to change, so do not speak up.
5. **The Nice Guy Factor**: Customers consider giving feedback but then self–talk, convincing themselves not to report a 'minor infraction'.
6. **Personal Reputation Factor**: Customers fear actual damage to their personal reputation or the relationship, especially where they rely on goodwill.
7. **The Partial Responsibility Factor**: Customers anticipate lack of action and/or retribution due to partial responsibility, even though they have a valid complaint.

On the customer side, these barriers must be overcome.

The second problem – capturing customer feedback and presenting it to businesses in a way that is easily consumable, useful for business improvement and leads to further engagement between the customer and the business.

Time–poor business owners and service managers cannot best manage customer relationships when engagement is spread across numerous domains, let alone make great use of the data that results. Responding to email, managing Facebook and Twitter posts, answering negative Yelp reviews, gathering survey data, answering phone calls, etc. The challenge is exaggerated for small business owners without the resources or staff to purchase and implement proper systems.

There are two aspects to this problem – how do we create a feedback system that makes it as easy as possible for businesses to manage customer engagement? And how does the system quickly tell businesses exactly what they want to know? Let's remember that this is not simply a matter of asking targeted questions. We can see from experience that surveys are not the answer. With all the market research requests we are bombarded with in 2015, survey response is low and survey fatigue is high – consider your own response to the last email survey request you received.

Getting the data is not necessarily found in a 5–page, in–depth market research analysis paper either. Certainly not for a business that wants regular informative updates on its operating environment. We are talking about regular current data.  And we mean current – data that can be interpreted as easily as checking the news. Information telling the business exactly what they need to know so they can take immediate action steps and create meaningful change.

We at Critik think there are four features to recognise if a feedback platform is going to be attractive to businesses.  In simple terms, the system needs to guarantee the following:

1. **Communication**: Feedback needs to be able to reach the intended recipient(s).
2. **Amplification**: Feedback needs to be able to be shared at each level of decision–making – from customer service at an operational level to strategic vision planning by senior management.
3. **Response–ability**: Feedback needs to be easy to respond to.  And we mean as easy and quick as sending an SMS.
4. **Capture and Analysis**: Feedback needs to be properly captured, with aggregated relevant data presented back to the business.

The solution? That’s in our next post.

title: Why People Don't Leave Feedback
date: October 7 2015
---
There are seven simple but significant barriers that stop consumers speaking up:

1. **The Effort Factor**: Customers want to provide feedback but ultimately cannot be bothered. Good intentions fail because it all just feels a bit exhausting.
2. **The Lack of Access Factor**: Customers are dissuaded by a lack of easily apparent ways to provide feedback.  Conversely, they feel they have no guarantee it will be passed to the intended recipient.
3. **The Embarrassment Factor**: Customers do not want to complain because of potential embarrassment to themselves or others.
4. **The Defeatist Factor**: Customers believe that their feedback is unlikely to lead to change, so do not speak up.
5. **The Nice Guy Factor**: Customers consider giving feedback but then self–talk, convincing themselves not to report a 'minor infraction'.
6. **Personal Reputation Factor**: Customers fear actual damage to their personal reputation or the relationship, especially where they rely on goodwill.
7. **The Partial Responsibility Factor**: Customers anticipate lack of action and/or retribution due to partial responsibility, even though they have a valid complaint.

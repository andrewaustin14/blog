title: The Solution

The objectives are clear: customers want to be heard, and businesses want the insights that will shape the way they operate in the future. If we can connect the two, we will increase customer satisfaction, fix problems, increase responsiveness to changing market conditions and ultimately boost revenue.

As we mentioned in our {% post_link the-problem previous post %}, the typical barriers for customers are effort, lack of access, embarrassment, defeatism, desiring to be the 'nice guy', personal reputation, and the partial responsibility factor. The barriers for businesses are obstructed communication channels, lack of amplification to decision makers, the difficulty of sending quick and effective responses, and capturing and analysing feedback to get maximum utility from the data.

Any solution needs to overcome the barriers on both sides of the equation. Our feedback solution is attractive to use for both customers and for businesses. Customers should not have to jump through hoops or feel they are being manipulated into providing fodder for marketing research. And businesses should feel able to manage customer relationships simply and on their own terms, not because they feel forced into a corner.

So we think the solution looks something like the following:

- **Efficient**: The solution recognises that customers often have an immediate snippet of information to share that is worth not more than a moment of their time.  And it recognises that business owners are busy, very busy.
- **Simple**: The solution encourages customer contribution by virtue of simple functionality, an enjoyable interface and the promise of creating genuine value.
- **Direct**: The solution guarantees a direct connection with business owners and/or customer service managers.  The customer should be able to trust that the person up the line who needs to know will find out.  The business should be able to trust that feedback is being fed up the line to the right decision makers.
- **Private**: The solution enables customers and businesses to keep feedback discreet.  And if it enables sharing for a wider audience, it does so in a way that protects privacy and does not unreasonably manipulate other parties in the exchange.
- **Anonymous**: The solution provides customers the choice whether to identify themselves. For those instances of potential embarrassment or where reputation may be at stake. The solution needs to do this whilst protecting businesses from anonymous spam feedback.
- **Manageable**: The solution makes it easy for businesses to respond to customers and for both customers and businesses to develop and track an ongoing conversation
- **Evaluative**:  The solution offers value-added analysis for businesses. It makes use of the feedback data and returns simple business intelligence.

There are two other features that would make the solution really click. A feedback system needs to appreciate that customers suffer from information saturation and a lack of time. If we are to encourage customers to provide feedback on their terms, we need it to be **universal** and **accessible**. A common platform that is usable anytime, anywhere, in relation to any commercial, not-for-profit or government entity. It has to stand alone and be readily usable. Essentially, on your mobile or tablet and without a complicated sign up.

Sound refreshing? We certainly think so, enough to give up our day jobs and make it happen for you.

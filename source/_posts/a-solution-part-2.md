title: A Solution to the Challenge of Collecting Feedback - Part 2
date: October 13 2015

In our {% post_link a-solution-part-1 last post %}, we began to discuss a solution to the challenge businesses face of collecting feedback from their customers. We think the solution looks something like the following:

- **Efficient**: The solution recognises that customers often have an immediate snippet of information to share that is worth not more than a moment of their time.  And it recognises that business owners are busy, very busy.
- **Simple**: The solution encourages customer contribution by virtue of simple functionality, an enjoyable interface and the promise of creating genuine value.
- **Direct**: The solution guarantees a direct connection with business owners and/or customer service managers.  The customer should be able to trust that the person up the line who needs to know will find out.  The business should be able to trust that feedback is being fed up the line to the right decision makers.
- **Private**: The solution enables customers and businesses to keep feedback discreet.  And if it enables sharing for a wider audience, it does so in a way that protects privacy and does not unreasonably manipulate other parties in the exchange.
- **Anonymous**: The solution provides customers the choice whether to identify themselves. For those instances of potential embarrassment or where reputation may be at stake. The solution needs to do this whilst protecting businesses from anonymous spam feedback.
- **Manageable**: The solution makes it easy for businesses to respond to customers and for both customers and businesses to develop and track an ongoing conversation
- **Evaluative**:  The solution offers value-added analysis for businesses. It makes use of the feedback data and returns simple business intelligence.

There are two other features that would make the solution really click. A feedback system needs to appreciate that customers suffer from information saturation and a lack of time. If we are to encourage customers to provide feedback on their terms, we need it to be **universal** and **accessible**. A common platform that is usable anytime, anywhere, in relation to any commercial, not-for-profit or government entity. It has to stand alone and be readily usable.

Sound refreshing? We certainly think so, enough to give up our day jobs and make it happen for you.

title: Survey Fatigue - Part 2

Is there a feedback sweet spot where customers and companies both can win?

Surveys are not the sweet spot. Businesses want to capture a high volume of data per customer to meet specific information requirements. They don't get much of a response. 20-30% response rates are considered a remarkable success while most surveys garner less than 10%.

Reviews in online public forums may be closer to that sweet spot. The customer gets to write on their terms. They can say what they want without wading through five pages of checkboxes or detailed questions not related to their experience. For companies, this presents some problems. Quantity and specificity of information is a big challenge.  Reviews are often polarised and less than objective. Even when there are enough data points to draw valid conclusions, feedback ends up scattered across multiple forums, leaving the company to collect and aggregate the data.

The biggest challenge here for companies is responding to customer reviews to manage their online presence. These days, no company or organisation is immune from the push to create a review profile at the insistence of a third party.  Once created, it is the vocal negative minority that shout the loudest. Having to placate the 5% in the name of demonstrating good customer service comes at the cost of delivering better service to the other 95%. And most of the 95% are generally satisfied with their experiences, they just don’t say it. It is no surprise then that companies end up feeling manipulated by the very services acquired to help them engage better with their customers.

So what is the answer?

Feedback is obviously still useful to companies. Author for The Australian, Diedre Macken [notes](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/customer-feedback-surveys-its-not-about-you-its-about-them/story-fn9n8gph-1227531763850), 'It’s cheap market information...and smart companies combine the feedback with data they have from your online interactions with them. Analytics are worth a lot more to them than to you.' Feedback helps companies reconstruct themselves, alter their marketing strategies and bring new products and services to market. Feedback should be collected in a way that does not pit the interests of the company (getting the information it wants) against those of the customer (saying what they want).

Diedre says, 'It’s time to even the score and start answering the questions we’d like to see on surveys.' We agree - it is time for customers to start saying what they want. But the answer is not exchanging surveys for more public rants.

In the good old days the customer was able to have a conversation with the business owner over the counter. In 2015, we think the answer is to provide a clear channel between the customer and the company in the digital space. One that is direct, protected and easier to access than a call centre or generic customer service inbox. Make it easier for customers to speak, and easier for companies to listen. And then get out of their way!

What is the cost you pay as a business owner for not loving your customer feedback? It could be more than you think.

Customers are actually remarkably forgiving of businesses with promises that are not initially delivered, as long as businesses respond to customers effectively, make good on their product or service promises and demonstrate that matters are improving. Not only might they forgive you but they might like you even more afterwards. Responding to a customer’s feedback is an opportunity to show how good you really are - a chance to win (or reinforce) the ongoing loyalty of a happy customer. For you, the business owner, it could be marketing gold.

Gaining a new customer can cost [seven times more](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/retaining-customers/) than retaining an existing one. It's worth keeping your tribe happy because customer churn is expensive and has a strong negative effect on your brand. Or to put it another way, feedback is an asset with an actual dollar value. Every dollar of time you spend on listening to your customers is a dollar you don’t have to spend on marketing.

[Statistics say](http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Launching-Profits-with-Customer-Loyalty-41678.aspx) that retail businesses out there lose 25-40% of their core customers every year. Crazy numbers! It means you retail business owners have to replace up to 40% of your customers every year just to stay on top! Between one quarter and one half of your marketing efforts are used to maintain your existing customer base.

If it costs you five times more to gain a new customer and you lose up to 40% of your customers each year, then surely you want to be putting as many of your dollars into effective feedback management as possible. And the additional costs of rewarding customers for good feedback or compensating them for unsatisfactory products or services will undoubtedly be offset by the savings in your marketing budget.

So what is the cost of not listening in? Ask yourself: how many thousands of dollars worth of customers can I keep with good feedback management?

Listening in to your customers might just be the best marketing tool you have.

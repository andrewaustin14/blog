What do organisations that offer great customer service look like? Some customer experience gold from US based customer service experts [Chip Bell and John Patterson](http://www.taketheirbreathaway.com/customer-insight/keeping-up-with-customer-insight/).

The best organisations:

- Involve in the customer intelligence gathering process those people who can make or influence substantive changes based on what is learned.
- Create sincere rapport with customers that will cause them to want to be honest.
- Convince customers that their input will honestly matter.
- Outline ways customers will be able to determine how the truth provided will be employed.
- Show no defensiveness when customers provide feedback that is painful, inaccurate or even unfair.
- Listen to learn â€“ not to defend, teach or make a point.
- Never make promises to customers they cannot or do not keep.

Acknowledgements to Deidre Macken for her piece on [Survey Fatigue](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/customer-feedback-surveys-its-not-about-you-its-about-them/story-fn9n8gph-1227531763850) for the Weekend Australian, September 19, 2015.

Diedre is spot on about the frustrations of survey-based feedback; the model cannot be escaped when it comes to online commerce. She writes:

> 'It’s easy to get lured into providing customer feedback. It makes you feel important.  It’s a way of getting frustrations out of your system. And there’s always the vague hope that at the end of the 10 pages of questions, a jackpot will ring and you’ll be off to Europe on an all expenses paid holiday.
>
> But many of us are getting survey fatigue. Yes, that’s an expression in marketing circles but it’s also how you feel when you get to the second page of a feedback form and start thinking, “this is not about me anymore".'

There are some common motivations that make us, the customers, want to provide feedback. Diedre gives us three:
1. It makes you feel important and validated.
2. It’s a way of getting frustrations out of your system.
3. For many of us, the promise of a reward is a small but real factor at play.

We add a fourth motivation: feedback is often aimed at solving a problem for yourself or for the company you’re speaking to. And for a small minority there is a fifth category: speaking up out of the completely altruistic desire to provide useful feedback to a stranger, be they the owner of the company or a member of the public. Call us cynical, but we think popular online review platforms owe their success to peoples' deep-seated desires for validation and not their altruistic tendencies.

Diedre identifies a key challenge – the imbalance between the customer’s motivations and the company’s desire for information:

> 'If you get to the second page of a feedback form, chances are that you are being asked to do the company’s market research, provide a performance rating for customer staff, redesign a website, contribute a testimonial to its advertising or, what’s worst, set yourself up for another selling opportunity from the company.'

But is it possible to find that sweet spot where both customers and companies feel they are getting a good deal from the exchange? Stay tuned.

title: How (not) to manage customer complaints
date: October 30 2015

Earlier this week, a popular Australian hotel chain got some less-than-positive media coverage for allegedly manipulating its TripAdvisor ratings. Emails surfaced showing it had bribed customers to remove negative feedback, in one instance offering a $100 discount to a guest for delete a bad review. The hotel was also accused of masking negative reviews by ensuring guests who complained did not receive TripAdvisor feedback forms.

Now that the allegations have surfaced, it clearly looks bad for the hotel. Selectively soliciting positive reviews is against TripAdvisor's terms of use and offering incentives for good feedback is considered fraudulent.

But perhaps the hotel's biggest mistake was failing to see the absolute gift that its complaining guests were offering. By taking a negative attitude towards negative feedback, the hotel not only compounded a bad outcome but missed out on a good one. Consider the situation if the hotel had decided to positively handle these negative TripAdvisor ratings and offer an exceptional level of customer service to its complaining guests:

- Customers are remarkably forgiving of a brand when they experience great service - the majority would have returned in the future.
- Those once complaining guests would have become brand ambassadors to family and friends.
- Potential guests would see that the hotel genuinely acted on feedback and more would have been forthcoming in the future, giving the company more opportunities to improve service and meet customer needs.
- The public would have seen the hotel as a place that went beyond expectations for its guests, leading to an increase in sales and profitability.
- Employees would have felt part of an enterprise that cared about its people, both customers and staff. Happier staff means better performance, decreased turnover and lower costs.
- The hotel would have encouraged an upwardly positive cycle of great customer service, repeat business, increased feedback and more opportunities to offer even better service in the future.

The irony is that had they received great customer service in response to their complaints, the same complaining guests may have offered additional positive reviews in lieu of their negative ones â€“ the very outcome the hotel was looking for.

Online ratings and reviews can seem to overwhelm a business's customer service department, especially in high volume sectors like accommodation and hospitality. But rather than trying to suppress it, using negative feedback to positively market your business will actually be beneficial for your bottom line.

Now that makes good business sense.

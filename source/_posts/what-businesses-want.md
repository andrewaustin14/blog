title: What Businesses Want from a Feedback Platform
date: October 8 2015

The second problem: capturing customer feedback and presenting it to businesses in a way that is easily consumable, useful for business improvement and leads to further engagement between the customer and the business.

Time–poor business owners and service managers cannot best manage customer relationships when engagement is spread across numerous domains, let alone make great use of the data that results. Responding to email, managing Facebook and Twitter posts, answering negative Yelp reviews, gathering survey data, answering phone calls, etc. The challenge is exaggerated for small business owners without the resources or staff to purchase and implement proper systems.

There are two aspects to this problem – how do we create a feedback system that makes it as easy as possible for businesses to manage customer engagement? And how does the system quickly tell businesses exactly what they want to know? Let's remember that this is not simply a matter of asking targeted questions. We can see from experience that surveys are not the answer. With all the market research requests we are bombarded with in 2015, survey response is low and survey fatigue is high – consider your own response to the last email survey request you received.

Getting the data is not necessarily found in a 5 page, in–depth market research analysis paper either. Certainly not for a business that wants regular informative updates on its operating environment. We are talking about regular current data.  And we mean current; data that can be interpreted as easily as checking the news. Information telling the business exactly what they need to know so they can take immediate action steps and create meaningful change.

We at Critik think there are four features to recognise if a feedback platform is going to be attractive to businesses.  In simple terms, the system needs to guarantee the following:

1. **Communication**: Feedback needs to be able to reach the intended recipient(s).
2. **Amplification**: Feedback needs to be able to be shared at each level of decision–making; from customer service at an operational level to strategic vision planning by senior management.
3. **Response–ability**: Feedback needs to be easy to respond to.  And we mean as easy and quick as sending an SMS.
4. **Capture and Analysis**: Feedback needs to be properly captured, with aggregated relevant data presented back to the business.

The solution? That’s in our next post.

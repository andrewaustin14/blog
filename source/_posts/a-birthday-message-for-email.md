title: A birthday message for email
date: November 12 2015

Email turned 44 years old last month. That's right, the first email was sent in 1971. And 22 years after it launched to the mainstream public, email is kicking goals as the most popular form of communication between customers and businesses.

So email has to be doing something right, right? Because despite all its younger competitors&mdash;the 20 year old search engines and the barely adolescent social media platforms&mdash;email is leading the way. And in the customer experience space, the unassuming veteran of digital communications is still capturing attention as the feedback platform of first choice.

What about the data? Microsoft recently released its 2015 report into multichannel customer service in the United Kingdom. You can check out the full report [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics/multichannel-customer-service). Let's agree that this study is broadly representative of customer engagement in a robust modern economy with a vibrant consumer sector - i.e. Britain has some lessons for the rest of us.

For those of you who aren't consumer experience geeks like us, here are the basics.

82% of customers regularly use email to engage a brand. This compares to 72% who jump on the telephone, 58% on live chat, 46% on Google or other search engine, 18% on social media and 14% who use online forums.

When it comes to first preference, the contrast is even starker. 96% of customers would prefer to use email, telephone or live chat, with a nearly even split between all three. And although an approximate [81% of small and medium businesses use social media](http://mashable.com/2014/02/13/linkedin-social-media-study/#kXvLyPP37sq3) as marketing strategy, only a mere 2% of customers favour social media as the best way to engage a brand. Stacked up against the plethora of social media and messaging platforms out there, why does email stand out?

A few thoughts. First, email promises direct contact with the decision maker, or at the minimum, a **real person**. This is critical, and it helps to explain why the telephone and live chat are so popular too. The idea of connecting with a real human being who, for a moment of their day is listening to just you, is an incredibly powerful motivator. This is especially valuable when you are upset, frustrated or thrilled by an experience - all common emotions at play when customers are motivated enough by a brand experience to provide feedback.

Two, **email is a reliable, consistent and universal interface**. Email is predictable. And that's what customers want. With the little time that customers are prepared to engage with a business to provide feedback, the variety of social media platforms and bespoke business apps out there just don't cut it. Keeping in mind that effort is still the biggest disincentive to customer feedback, email is just easy. Every business has an email address. There is no need to download an app or sign up to an extra account and it's accessible through your inbox - the same inbox every time. And you can be fairly sure that your message will end up in front of the person you intended it to. These features don't guarantee great customer service at the other end, but they are a great start.

And finally number three, **email balances formality and ease of use just nicely**. What do we mean? Well in the same way that writing a letter offers the innate satisfaction of having told your story on paper, email echoes this. It guarantees a certain level of respect between writer and reader. And in a way that a tweet, a like or a comment box blurb often cannot. It is also private, which in the age of information overshare gives our stories the credibility that we want them to have.

At the same time, email is still easy. With 75% of customers starting their engagement with a brand on their computer and 25% on a mobile, it is the choice at hand. Fire off an email and get on your way. Better than sitting on the telephone listening to call centre music and definitely better than looking for your old writing paper in the study.

Remember that this mix of formality and ease is particularly important for a customer who has had a bad experience and just wants to be heard and acknowledged by the business they are communicating with. If this acknowledgement (aka thoughtfulness) isn't forthcoming, the customer can also get a similar emotional satisfaction from publicly shaming the business online. As a business, we know what we'd prefer.

Some key takeaways for any business which cares about its customers. Email is not the only answer but it has definitely has some life experience to offer its younger counterparts.

Happy birthday, email.
